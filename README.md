# Kendo-Scoreboard
Python Based Scoreboard for Kendo Taikai - VERY EARLY DAY's
## Goal
This is meant to end up as a simple lightweight soreboard program to run on raspberry pi.

The philosphy should be to produce the electronic equivalent to a physical scoreboard.
\
It should end up not requiring networking as running a network in a sportshall can be challenging and even if networking capabilities are added they should not be neccesary it order to use the software.
