# Kendo-Scoreboard
Python Based Scoreboard for Kendo Taikai - VERY EARLY DAY's
Please don't flood me with bug reports just yet as there are loads and I need to clear off the obvious ones first.
Please do send mistakes. For example, "the symbol for Men is wrong" (it isn't, I'm not that dumb :) )
## Goal
This is meant to end up as a simple lightweight soreboard program to run on raspberry pi.
\
The philosphy should be to produce the electronic equivalent to a physical scoreboard.
\
It should end up not requiring networking as running a network in a sportshall can be challenging and even if networking capabilities are added they should not be neccesary it order to use the software.
## Prerequisites
So far it uses only Python 3.10 and pysimplegui.
I've provided an exe for non-coder windows users to check out. This may trigger you antivirus (it triggers mine). Obviously, procede at your own caution! I can't be responsible for any harm that may occur running this very very alpha stage program on your system.
